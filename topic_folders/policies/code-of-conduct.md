The South African Centre for Digital Language Resources (SADiLaR) aims to provide events organised for the benefit of its participants and for the advancement of research and scholarship in the variety of disciplines and professions they represent. SADiLaR works actively towards the creation of a more diverse, welcoming, and inclusive global community of digital humanities scholars and practitioners, and is therefore dedicated to the creation of a safe, respectful, and collegial experience for all attendees.

Open, critically-engaged, and often challenging discourse is expected to flourish at SADiLaR events. Participants and speakers are encouraged to respect and celebrate cultural and linguistic differences, and to be mindful of the international nature of our community in preparing presentations and engaging in conversation.

There is no place at SADiLaR events for harassment or intimidation of any kind, including that based on race, religion, ethnicity, language, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, physical or cognitive ability, age, appearance, or other group status. Unsolicited physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, and bullying behaviour are likewise unacceptable.

In the event a participant has been made to feel unsafe or unwelcome at a SADiLaR event, please report to either the Project Manager or Senior Communication Specialist of SADiLaR. Any reports will be treated in confidence.
