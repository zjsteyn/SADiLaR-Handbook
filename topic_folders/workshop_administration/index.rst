WORKSHOP AND EVENT ADMINISTRATION
=================================

As part of SADiLaR's mandate we run workshops within the domain of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Workshops can be requested by external parties from our `website <https://www.sadilar.org/index.php/proposals-and-workshops/request-a-workshop>`_, once a request is received it is reviewed and if approved an event will be created on Trello using the SADiLaR workshop template.
